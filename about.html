              I used different tags so that i could
              structure my code and my website how i wanted it to look.
              Furthermore, i used the class attribute to help structure
              my site properly in regards to how i wanted it to look.
              I used CSS to style the sections, so that they looked like
              they were in place, and were the right size according to the
              information i wanted to put in them. Also to style the pictures.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the portfolio section i included three projects; a picture of the project,
              a description, and the name of the project. This way a potential employer can
              look into these projects and see for himself how they look. In the resume section
              I included my relevant experience, languages and the skills i have; neatly displayed
              on a list. This will make it simple and easy for a potential employer.
