                Helicopter rescue 1 is a game I made for a company mainly using
                Javascript. This Is a 9+ app and we have made a game that can be
                played when you are travelling or at home bored. This Is a
                simple game that can be played by absolutely anyone.

              <p>
                I have also made a website for Norbygata Engros using a
                combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is a website for a
                company named Norbygata, they import and sell food and daily
                products like toothbrushes and cakes. The function of this
                website is to make the ordering process digital and time
                efficient.

              <p>
                As the third project I made a calculator app which can be used
                on the phone and computer. We tried to build a simple calculator
                that was easy to use and access. This was time consuming
                project, but at the end It was all worth it. This calculator was
                made using C#.
